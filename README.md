# D3: Physics game


 - Where to play the game: https://applesketch.github.io/physics
 - The game is continuous with/without inputs from the player
 - When the player does nothing, you lose the game. When the player interacts with the game, they can try to get as high a score as possible.
 - I used Photoshop to create all assets in this game.
